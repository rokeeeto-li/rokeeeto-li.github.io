Welcome! I am Qihang Li, and I am currently serving as a Research Intern at the [Spatial AI and Robotics (SAIR) lab](https://sairlab.org/). Prior to joining SAIR, I earned my MSE in Robotics from Johns Hopkins University and received my BEng in Mechatronics and Robotic Systems from a joint program between Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) and the University of Liverpool.

Research Interests
-----
My current research interest lies in **robot motion planning and learning**. For the long-term, I aim to improve robots' ability to generalize, so they can handle a broad range of tasks commonly encountered in human life. Concurrently, I am committed to being a full-stack learner in robotics, covering a comprehensive range of skills and knowledge in the field.

Before joining the SAIR lab, I conducted robotics research at the [Laboratory of Biomechanical and Image Guided Surgical Systems (BIGSS)](https://bigss.lcsr.jhu.edu/). My work there focused on continuum manipulators, specifically in perception and planning, with the objective of reducing surgical injuries in orthopedic procedures. I continue to maintain a strong interest and respect for topics related to medical robotics.
