Welcome! I am Qihang Li, and I am currently serving as a Research Intern at the [Spatial AI and Robotics (SAIR) lab](https://sairlab.org/). Prior to joining SAIR, I earned my MSE in Robotics from Johns Hopkins University and received my BEng in Mechatronics and Robotic Systems from a joint program between Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) and the University of Liverpool.

Research Interests
-----
My current research interest is in **robot motion planning and learning**. I am particularly captivated by the challenges posed by motion planning in complex environments and high-dimensional state spaces. My long-term goal is to enhance robots' generalization capabilities, allowing them to effectively navigate and perform tasks in diverse human-centric settings.

Alongside my research, I am committed to being a full-stack learner in robotics. I believe it is benificial because the field is highly coupled; a broad skill set enables me to tackle complex challenges more effectively.

Before joining the SAIR lab, I conducted robotics research at the [Laboratory of Biomechanical and Image Guided Surgical Systems (BIGSS)](https://bigss.lcsr.jhu.edu/). My work there focused on **continuum manipulators**, specifically in perception and planning, with the objective of reducing surgical injuries in orthopedic procedures. I continue to maintain a strong interest and respect for topics related to medical robotics.
