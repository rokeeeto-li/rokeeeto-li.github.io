Welcome! I am Qihang Li, and I am currently serving as a Research Intern at the [Spatial AI and Robotics (SAIR) lab](https://sairlab.org/). Before joining SAIR, I earned my MSE in Robotics from Johns Hopkins University and received my BEng in Mechatronics and Robotic Systems from a joint program between Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) and the University of Liverpool.

Research Interests
-----
My current research is focused on **robot planning and learning** to imbue robots with higher and more generalized intelligence. I aim to embed a deeper understanding of physical laws into robotic systems, to enhance their predictive capabilities.

Alongside my research, I am committed to being a full-stack learner in robotics. I believe it is beneficial because the field is highly coupled; a broad skill set enables me to tackle complex challenges more effectively.

Before joining the SAIR lab, I conducted robotics research at the [Laboratory of Biomechanical and Image Guided Surgical Systems (BIGSS)](https://bigss.lcsr.jhu.edu/). My work there focused on **continuum manipulators**, specifically in perception and planning, to reduce surgical injuries in orthopedic procedures. I continue to maintain a strong interest and love for topics related to medical robotics.
